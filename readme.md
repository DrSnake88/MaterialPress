MaterialPress v 0.1
===================

Welcome to the beginning of MaterialPress!

MaterialPress is a WordPress theme, influenced heavily by Google's Material Design philosophy. Several front end styles have been adapted from the [Materialize](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) front-end framework. 

MaterialPress is in extreme infancy, (*I literally had the idea just a few days ago*), so I am looking forward to adding more to make this a quality open source WordPress theme for those of us who love and appreciate Google's new aesthetic.
