Welcome to the beginning of MaterialPress! 
------------------------------------------

MaterialPress is a WordPress theme, influenced heavily by Google's Material Design philosophy. Several front end styles have been adapted from the [Materialize](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize) front-end framework. 

MaterialPress is in extreme infancy, (*I literally had the idea just a few days ago*), so I am looking forward to adding more to make this a quality open source WordPress theme for those of us who love and appreciate Google's new aesthetic.

Feature Roadmap
---------------

+ General markup clean up and organization (I did this so quickly, please forgive me!)
+ Add support for widgets, sidebar and footer widget areas 
+ Comment support
+ Theme customizer options, including custom headers and background colors
+ Additional JS from Materialize front-end framework
+ Styles for post formats

More features will be added to the roadmap as time goes on. I'm shooting to have the first public version of the theme ready for testing and submission to the theme repository soon.
